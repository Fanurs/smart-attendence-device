# Smart Attendence Device

This is my own practice code for the Smart Attendence Device project, organized by the AI Club at Michigan State University (MSU). For official updates, please refer to https://github.com/MSU-AI/Attendance-Project.

The project is split into several teams. Currently, this project only focuses on the hand gesture recognition component by Code Team 1, which is put under the branch "[interaction](https://github.com/MSU-AI/Attendance-Project/tree/interaction)".
